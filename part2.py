______
In the code below, the user is asked to enter three numbers, and then prints a single statement depending on how many of the input numbers are equal. However, there are (at least) 6 syntax errors in the code that need to be fixed. Even after all the syntax errors are fixed and the code runs without errors, there is still a bug. Fix the code so that it runs the way it should.

(Hint: If you see a red squiggly line in the code, that probably means there is a syntax error there.)

num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter another number: "))

if(num1 == num2 == num3)
  print("All three numbers are equal.")

if(num1 = num2 or num2 = num3 or num1 = num3):
print("Exactly two of the numbers are equal.")

else
  print("None of the numbers are equal.")
